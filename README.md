Ding Dong

What is Ding Dong? 
Ding Dong a react web application that offers a socially conscious apartment concierge service.
Ding Dong was created when we realised the mass ammount of paper waste which was created by 1 aprtment building in Manchetser. The problem: Evertime a parcel arrived a piece of paper was being delivered to an apartments letter box. This was causing excessive waste - which wasn't guaranteed to be recycled! 
The solution: Ding Dong. A simple notification system created to inform tenants they have a parcel waiting to be picked up. 
What is our primary objective?
Build a responsive Web-App for apartment concierge services to inform tenants of parcels ready for collection.
